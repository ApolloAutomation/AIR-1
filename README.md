Key Features of the AIR-1 Sensor:

MiCS-4514 Below have individual gas % readout: CO, C2H5OH (Alcohol), H2, NO2, and NH3

SCD40: CO2 and includes temperature and humidity sensing capabilities. 

SEN55: Particulate matter (PM1, PM2.5, PM10), VOCs, NOx, humidity, and temperature. 

DPS310: Barometric air pressure and temperature.

Dimensions & Design: 

The AIR-1 measures just 61mm x 61mm x 30mm, and we have focused on efficient heat management within this small package to maintain sensor accuracy. This includes a thoughtful PCB layout and case design, incorporating ventilation and strategic component placement.
